Telegram bot for creating teams from positive response in a poll

It uses https://aiogram.dev/ as a python API for telegram bots

For deploying in on another serveur, rename config_example.txt as config.txt and replace bot_token by the token of your bot (you have to create another bot if you want to deploy this script elsewhere)
